    "This project aims to analyse Business and users' behaviour to help businesses under COVID-19 using Yelp Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Preliminary Analysis part, Spark SQL is mainly used to analyze information in four JSON files, business.json, review.json, user.json, and COVID-19.json of Yelp Dataset. For businesses dataset: there are most businesses in Austin. Besides, most businesses are in the restaurant category. There are 37337 businesses closed, which accounts for 23.23% of all businesses. With respect to ratings, most businesses get 4 stars, which means they perform relatively well. For users dataset: review_count and fans are analyzed to find the number of reviews sent by people and followings of people. Futhermore, there was a rapid increase in the number of new users from year 2004 to year 2015 and maximum growth rate of new users is in 2015, with 267516 new users. However, number of users in Yelp increased slowly in 2020 and 2021, which might caused by the COVID-19. For reviews dataset, most reviews have ratings of five stars. Also, we regards reviews with stars larger than and equal to 4 as positive reviews, reviews with stars equal to 3 as positive reviews, and the remaining reviews are negative reviews, then the percentage of each types of reviews are analysed. To adapt to the effects of COVID-19, businesses provides some extra services, such as virtual services and delivery services to operating businesses udner COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Sentiment Analysis part, Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is implemented to find high frequency topics in positive and negative reviews. There is obvious different between topics in positive and negative reviews, so topics can be used to indicate sentiment of reviews. To measure the performance of LDA model, perplexity is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no evidence that more partitions can decrease execution time with the experiments of different query using different numbers of partitions. Too many partitions may cause scheduling problems of small tasks. Too few partitions may cause network traffic when sending and collecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project is a useful guide for people who are interested to learn from customers' reviews to improve their products and services and to discover target market. Furthermore, this report may be useful to discover how to operate businesses under COVID-19 providing different services, such as virtual services. At the same time, distributed computing for big data is more and more popular to discover value from large volume and wide variety of data. This project using Dataproc cluster on GCP, execute Spark SQL query and data mining algorithm using worker nodes to reduce computation time.\n"

    "k for LDA model is constant 20 and the coherence measures can be implemented to find the optimal k value for LDA model with highest coherence score. Besides, different number of worker nodes can be implemented to examine how execution time to train LDA model interacts with number of worker nodes, to improve the efficiency of implementation of LDA model.\n",

    "### 8.2 Conclusion of results:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, There are various categories of businesses in Yelp Dataset, from restaurants to Health & Medical and Restaurant has most number of businesses in Yelp Dataset. At the same time, businesses are located in different cities and different states. Further more, almost 76.75% businesses survive and many businesses are rated high with stars larger than 4. Yelp was founded in 2004 and the first user joined Yelp at 08:45:11 on 12 October, 2004. The number of users in Yelp increased rapidly from 2010 to 2017. However, number of users in Yelp increased slowly in 2020 and 2021, which might caused by the COVID-19. To adapt to the effects of COVID-19, businesses provides some extra services, such as virtual services and delivery services to operating businesses udner COVID-19. Interestingly, \n",
    "\n",
    "To do the sentiment analysis, LDA is implemented to extract hidden topics from text of positive reviews and negative reviews. Most of topics returned by LDA model for positive reviews are specific nouns, such as kebab and vermicelli, which does not contains the sentiment. It may indicate that kebab and vermicelli are popular food in the market. However, most of topics returned by LDA model for negative reviews has negative sentiment, such as disgusting and flavorless, which might means the food tastes bad for some restaurants. Compared with LDA model of positive reviews, topics returned by LDA model of negative reviews has an obvious negative sentiment, so there is difference between topics in positive reviews and negative reviews and topics can use to indicate the sentiment of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine how execution time interacts with number of partitions, query with different complexity executed in different data set with different numbers of partitions. There is no evidence that there is monotonic increase or decrease of execution time when numbers of partitions increase monotonically. If the number of partitions is small, then there is high volume of data in memory of one executor nodes. Therefore, computation speed might be unequal and slow. If there is too many partitions, then scheduling too many small tasks might affect the execution speed.\n"
