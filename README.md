## Project title:

Yelp data analysis: Business and customers' (users') behaviours under COVID-19

## Summary:


Because of COVID-19 from the beginning of year 2020, business and customers' (users') behaviours have been affected. Based on the Yelp datasets, this project is aimed to use Google Cloud Platform, querying, machine learning method, NLP (not sure) to analyse how COVID-19 affects the business and customers' (users') behaviour through the following analysis:

1. Analyse data of categories, locations(city, longitude and latitude), opening hours, operating state (open or closed), attributes of main business
2. Analyse data of reviews, fans, texts, stars, checkins of customers (users)

Matplotlib is applied to illustrate analysis in graphs.

When machine learning methods are used to do analysis, different models can be used to evaluate which model is the best.
